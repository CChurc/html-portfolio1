<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to Christina</h1>
<hr />
<h2>My top 10 Movies</h2>
<h3>It's A Wonderful Life</h3>
<p>An annual favorite for the holidays. But it is more then that.  Its a
    masterclass on living your authentic self, whether you know it or not.</p>
<h3>Jaws</h3>
<p>The fear it gives you isnt all production, its the unknown monster.  
    Quotable quotes, deep characters and moving plot.  A must see before 
    visiting the ocean</p>    
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>Are you not entertained? How could you not be?</p>
